            <img class="profilePic" src="assets/images/Profile Pic.jpeg">
            <p>Raised in Austin, graduate of The University of Texas, I am embarking on the next great challenge of my life: Coding with an emphasis towards Web Development. I grew up in the amazing city of Austin, Texas and look forward to many more years of working in what is sure to be a tech hub of the southwest. Thus far in my career of 13 years, I've almost exclusively worked in retail banking, save for a few months delivering pizzas (best job ever!).  If I have any free time, you probably won't find me sitting on the couch at home, but rather chasing my golf ball all over creation as I pray to keep my score under 100. I can also be found cruising down the highway on my motorcycle from time to time, or even possibly pushing around on my skateboard.</p>
